# ReactAssignment

## Approach of work

I began working on this assignment by doing a simple analysis of the provided Figma design and JSON file. This first step was important because it gave me a clear plan for how to build the app. It helped me break down the work into smaller and easier tasks. I chose to keep things simple and organized by structuring the project into reusable components, making sure each component had a specific responsibility.

## Future improvments

Give more time, there are several improvments that I would add to enhance the user experience:

- Progress Bar: Implement a progress bar that allows users to track their progress while solving exercises, giving them a clear view of how much they have completed.

- Saving progress: Add a feature that saves the user's progress so they can pick up where they left off if they don't finish all the exercises in one go.

- User Feedback: Provide detailed explanations for the answers, allowing users to learn from their mistakes after selecting an option.

- Ensure that the user can't move forward if they don't select an answer.
  
- Responsive Design: Enhance the appâ€™s responsive design so it runs smoothly across all types of devices.
